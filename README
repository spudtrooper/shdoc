DESCRIPTION

This utility helps you document shell-script functions by generating man files from inline documentation of sh functions.


USAGE

To use, you must run this on a file that contains shell functions.
Namely, you'll probably run it on a file included in the list of files
you source at login.  For example, if you have a file called
.functions that contains the following:

# Description of the function
# @param one an argument to the function
function some_function() {
    echo "something $1"
}

This would generate a man page for the function 'some_function' that
looks like this:

SOME_FUNCTION()                                            SOME_FUNCTION()

NAME
       some_function

SYNOPSIS
       some_function one

DESCRIPTION
       Description of the function

OPTIONS
       one    an argument to the function

                                                           SOME_FUNCTION()

The man pages are create in $HOME/man, so you'll need to add the
following to one of your login files -- e.g. .bashrc:

export MANPATH=$MANPATH:$HOME/man


BOOSTRAPPING

There is a file .shdoc that defines the function 'shdoc' and generates a man page, such as:

SHDOC()                                                                SHDOC()

NAME
       shdoc

SYNOPSIS
       shdoc files

DESCRIPTION
       Generates man pages for shell-script function definitions

OPTIONS
